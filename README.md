"Blokus is a strategy board game that involves placing geometric pieces onto a square grid. The goal of the game is to place as many pieces as possible onto the board while preventing your opponents from doing the same. Each player has a set of pieces made up of different arrangements of square tiles, and the pieces must be placed so that they touch at least one of the player's previously placed pieces, but only at the corners. The game ends when no more pieces can be placed, and the player with the fewest remaining pieces is the winner."
